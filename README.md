I built and tested a web application WAR file using Maven and Sonarqubel.Then, I built the WAR file into a docker image and  pushed it to Dockerhub and Nexus repository. Next, I deployed the web application image on a Tomcat server using the Jenkins Pipeline project. Additionally, I monitored the Jenkins metrics using Prometheus and Grafana by launching them within the Docker container.
